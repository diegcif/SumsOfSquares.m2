######## IMPROVE ########
#########################

The following methods need to be improved

1) changeRingField doesn't work on quotient rings
1) realZeros should work on a nontrivial example
2) createSOSModel should be faster than solving the SDP


#########################
######## TESTING ########
#########################

Implement tests for the following methods

3) sosdec (missing over RR)
7*) LDLdecomposition
9*) choosemonp
10) createSOSModel

The following methods need a test that accepts the Solver as an input

14*) solveSDP
15*) solveSOS
16) sosdecTernary
17) sosInIdeal
18) lowerBound
--19) lasserreHierarchy--

The methods marked with (*) already have some tests, but need more.

NOTE: All methods must be tested with inputs over QQ and over RR.

####### DEBUGGING #######
#########################

Known bugs:

4) Numerators in bugs/sosdecTernaryHarris.m2 lie in different rings

5) In the first test of lasserreHierarchy it sometimes happens that
   rounding fails.  In this case the last few lines of solveSOS fail,
   because they call changePolyField with f being a matrix.  I can't
   reproduce this at the moment because rounding is always successful.

6) LDLdecomposition decomposes (matrix{{1,-1,1},{-1,1,1},{1,1,1}})
   but fails the test. Of course it has one eigenvalue negative, so it shouldn't decompose.

7) The following works over QQ but fails over RR (true solution -.178)
    R = RR[x,z]
    f = x^4+x^2+z^6-3*x^2*z^2;
    (bound,mon,Q,X) = lowerBound (f,Solver=>"SDPA");

Methods without documentation

--1) sosPoly--

--6) genericCombination--

Methods whose documentation needs improvement

7) sumSOS
8) roundPSDmatrix
9) choosemonp
10) lowerBound   TK: Calling it with parameters is not documented
11) lasserreHierarchy   TK: Options are not documented yet.

2) The function sosInIdeal is worthless if it can't even solve
    R = QQ[x,y,z];
    h = {x-y, x+z};
    (s,mult) = sosInIdeal (h,10, Solver=>"CSDP");
    diego: it seems to work with d=4, why did you choose d=10??
    --> The result is too complicated.  This may be a bug.

3) Maybe we should implement that each RingMap can be applied to an
   SOSpoly?
   TK does it if it is easy (5 lines).

6) The following example only works with SDPA, but not M2 and not
   CSDP.  Can we do anything about it?
   needsPackage ("SOS" , Configuration => { "CSDPexec" => "CSDP/csdp", "SDPAexec"=>"./sdpa"})
   R = QQ[x,y]
   f = (x-y)^2 + x^2 + (y-4)^2;
   (bound, sol) = lowerBound(f, Solver=>"SDPA");
   -- the minimum is 16/3.
   result = (abs (16/3-bound) < 0.1)

Sketch of the paper (might change)

1) brief introduction to SOS, nonnegativity, polynomial optimization
2) computing SOS decompositions (Motzkin, Robinson, Lax-Lax)
2) computing SOS decompositions of ternary forms (Harris)
3) parametrized SOS problems
4) SOS optimization (lowerBound, lasserreHierarchy)
